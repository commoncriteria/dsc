      <term full="Data Execution Prevention" abbr="DEP">
	An anti-exploitation feature of modern operating systems executing on
	modern computer hardware, which enforces a non-execute permission on pages of memory.
	DEP prevents pages of memory from containing both data and instructions, which makes
	it more difficult for an attacker to introduce and execute code.

	A class of OSes designed to support a wide-variety of workloads consisting of many concurrent applications or services.
	Typical characteristics for OSes in this class include support for third-party applications,
	support for multiple users, and security separation between users and their respective resources.
	General Purpose Operating Systems also lack the real-time constraint that defines Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS).
	RTOSes typically power routers, switches, and embedded devices.

					The intent of this requirement is to ensure that attackers cannot recover SKs with less than a full
					exhaust of the key space. This requirement explains SK generation regardless of how the DSC uses
					it or when it generates it. The encryption of user data that is not keying material, authentication
					tokens, or authorization values is outside the scope of this cPP. This cPP assumes that the DSC
					lacks the required resources to perform bulk encryption/decryption services at a suitable rate for
					users. The host may use the SK for encrypting user data outside the boundaries of the DSC. On
					the other hand, the DSC may use the SK on behalf of the user to perform keyed hashes. In this
					case, all the requirements for generating, controlling access and use, and destroying the key while
					under the protection of the DSC apply.<h:p/>
					The selection of key size 512 bits is for the case of XTS-AES using AES-256. In the case of XTSAES

					generated using direct generation from the RBG as in NIST SP 800-133 section.<h:p/>
					The ST author selects at least one algorithm from the RSK row if the ST supports creating keys
					directly from the output of the RBG without further conditioning, at least one algorithm from the
					DSK row should be selected if the ST supports key derivation functions which are usually seeded
					from RBG and then further conditioned to the appropriate key size, and at least one algorithm
					from the PBK row should be selected if the ST supports keys derived from passwords.<h:p/>

				identification keys.<h:p/>
				In the case of volatile memory, the selection “removal of all references to the key directly followed
				by a request for garbage collection” is used in a situation where the TSF cannot address the
				specific physical memory locations holding the data to be erased and therefore relies on
				addressing logical addresses (which frees the relevant physical addresses holding the old data)
				and then requesting the platform to ensure that the data in the physical addresses is no longer
				available for reading (i.e. the “garbage collection” referred to in the SFR text).
				Guidance documentation for the TOE requires users not to allow the TOE to leave the user’s
				control while a session is active (and hence while the DEK is likely to be in plaintext in volatile
				memory).<h:p/>
				The selection for destruction of data in non-volatile memory includes block erase as an option,
				and this option applies only to flash memory. A block erase does not require a read verify, since 
				collaborative Protection Profile for Dedicated Security Components
				the mappings of logical addresses to the erased memory locations are erased as well as the data
				itself.<h:p/>
				Where different destruction methods are used for different data or different destruction situations
				then the different methods and the data/situations they apply to (e.g. different points in time, or
				power-loss situations) are described in the TSS (and the ST may use separate iterations of the SFR
				to aid clarity). The TSS includes a table describing all relevant keys and keying material (including
				authorization data) used in the implementation of the SFRs, stating the source of the data, all
				memory types in which the data is stored (covering storage both during and outside of a session,
				and both plaintext and non-plaintext forms of the data), and the applicable destruction method
				and time of destruction in each case.<h:p/>
				Some selections allow assignment of “some value that does not contain any CSP.” This means
				that the TOE uses some specified data not drawn from an RBG meeting FCS_RBG_EXT
				requirements, and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. The point
				of the phrase “does not contain any sensitive data” is to ensure that the overwritten data is
				carefully selected, and not taken from a general pool that might contain current or residual data
				(e.g. SDOs or intermediate key chain values) that itself requires confidentiality protection.<h:p/>

				The DSC will have mechanisms to destroy keys, including intermediate keys and key material, by

					Note that Camellia algorithms do not support 192-bit key sizes.<h:p/>
					The interface referenced in the requirement could take different forms, the most likely of which is
					an application programming interface to an OS kernel. There may be various levels of abstraction.
					For Authorization Factor Submasks, the key size to be used in the HMAC falls into a range between
					L1 and L2 defined in ISO/IEC 10118 for the appropriate hash function (for example for SHA-256
					L1 = 512, L2 =256) where L2 = k = L1.<h:p/>
					General note: in order to use a NIST SP 800-108 conformant method of key derivation, the TOE
					is permitted to implement this with keys as derived as indicated in Key Derivation Functions table
					above, and with the algorithms as indicated in the same table.<h:p/>
					NIST SP 800-131A Rev 1 allows the use of SHA-1 in these use cases.<h:p/>
					KeyDrv5, KeyDrv6, and the XOR option in KeyDrv4 will create an “inverted key hierarchy” in
					which the TSF will combine two or more keys to create a third key. These same KDFs may also
					use a submask key as input, which could be an authorization factor or derived from a PBKDF. In
					these cases the ST author must explicitly declare this option and should present a reasonable
					argument that the entropy of the inputs to the KDFs will result in full entropy of the expected
					output.<h:p/>
					If keys are combined, the ST author shall describe which method of combination is used in order
					to justify that the effective entropy of each factor is preserved.<h:p/>
					The documentation of the product’s encryption key management should be detailed enough that,
					after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the product’s key management and how it
					meets the requirements to ensure the keys are adequately protected. This documentation should
					include an essay and diagrams. This documentation is not required to be part of the TSS; it can be
					submitted as a separate document and marked as developer proprietary.<h:p/>
					SP 800-56C specifies a two-step key derivation procedure that employs an extraction-thenexpansion technique for deriving keying material from a shared secret generated during a key
					establishment scheme. The Randomness Extraction step as described in Section 5 of SP 800-56C
					is followed by Key Expansion using the key derivation functions defined in SP 800-108.<h:p/>
					This requirement must be claimed by the TOE if at least one of FCS_CKM.1/KEK,
					FCS_CKM.1/SK, or FCS_COP.1/KeyEnc chooses a selection related to key derivation.<h:p/>
					If at least one of KeyDrv4, KeyDrv5, or KeyDrv6 is selected AND password-based key derivation
					is used to create at least one of the inputs, the selection-based SFR FCS_COP.1/PBKDF must also
					be claimed.<h:p/>

    <section title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="SARs">
      The Security Objectives in <xref to="Security_Objectives"/> were constructed
      to address threats identified in
      <xref to="Threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs)
      in <xref to="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. <h:br/> This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
      o be performed are specified both in 
      <xref to="SFRs"/> as well as in this section. <h:br/>
      The general model for evaluation of OSs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <h:br/>
      After the  ST has been approved for evaluation, the TSEF will obtain the
        OS, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within <xref to="SFRs"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <xref to="SFRs"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP.
     <section title="Class ASE: Security Target" id="ase">As per ASE activities
        defined in <xref to="bibCEM"/>.</section>
      <section title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">The information about the OS is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the TSS portion of the ST. The OS developer must concur with the description of the product that is
        contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The Assurance Activities

          functional specification describes the TSFIs. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because OSs conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by OS
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance

          functionality described in the TSS as well as the administrative
          (including configuration and operational) documentation provided. The focus of the testing
          is to confirm that the requirements specified in <xref to="SFRs"/> being met,
          although some additional testing is specified for SARs in <xref to="SARs"/>. The
          Assurance Activities identify the additional testing activities associated with these
          components. The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of
          testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the platform/OS
          combinations that are claiming conformance to this PP. Given the scope of the OS and its associated evaluation evidence requirements, this component’s
          assurance activities are covered by the assurance activities listed for ALC_CMC.1.

              <aactivity>The evaluator will prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the 
              <xref to="bibCEM"/> and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. <h:br/> While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform. <h:br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.</aactivity>

      <section id="ava" title="Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment">For the first generation of
        this protection profile, the evaluation lab is expected to survey open sources to discover
        what vulnerabilities have been discovered in these types of products. In most cases, these

        penetration tools are created and uniformly distributed to the evaluation labs, the
        evaluator will not be expected to test for these vulnerabilities in the OS. The labs will be expected to comment on the likelihood of these vulnerabilities given
        the documentation provided by the vendor. This information will be used in the development
        of penetration testing tools and for the development of future protection profiles.

              uses and document formats it parses.

              vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector
              needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
              requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not
              be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.</aactivity>

  <appendix title="Optional Requirements" id="optional"> As indicated in <xref to="ccl"/>,
    the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the OS) are

    The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be included
    in the ST, but are not required in order for a OS to claim conformance to

    in the body of the PP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in that
    appendix must be included. The third type (in <xref to="objective"/> are components that
    are not required in order to conform to this PP, but will be included in the baseline
    requirements in future versions of this PP, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note that the
    ST author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with those in
      <xref to="optional"/>, <xref to="sel-based"/>, and <xref to="objective"/>
